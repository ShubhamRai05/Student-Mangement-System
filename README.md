# Student Management System

About the problem:
For Every Institute there is an important task for the administrative department to 
store and manage student data information in detail in a Procedure Oriented 
Manner. To Override the Problem, Prevailing in the Practicing of the manual 
system. We have created a simple design for the Student management system in 
which we have various modules which will be helpful for the administrative 
department to store the student data for longer periods with easy access.


The Primary Reason to Choose this Topic:
In the recent system, most of the work is done manually. It is very time-consuming 
and costly. The reason for the student management system is to change the existing 
manual system to computerized automation and full-fledged computer software.

The Main Objective of the Project:
1. Providing the online interface for students, admins, and faculty.
2. Increasing the efficiency of college record management.
3. Decreasing the time required to access and live student records.
4. Tracking of the student information.


Scope of the Project:
In the Recent system, all the activities are done manually. This project which 
yields centralized software makes work administration and management easier and 
provides detailed information about the topic of user’s interest in just one mouse 
click. This makes the daily tasks of the students and faculties easier by 
coordinating and scheduling.
